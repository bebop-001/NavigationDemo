 * To fix:
 *    Note: Some input files use unchecked or unsafe operations.
 *    Note: Recompile with -Xlint:unchecked for details.
 * The message suggest you recompile with args -Xlint to get more
 * warning details, add these code to build.gradle:
 *
 * allprojects {
 *     tasks.withType(JavaCompile) {
 *         options.compilerArgs << "-Xlint:unchecked" << "-Xlint:deprecation"
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * Then you can fix warnings by detailed messages.  For example, you can
 * replace deprecated method with new method(there always been a new method
 * since old method has been deprecated) .
 *
 * However, sometimes we don't want change our code for some reasons, we
 * just want get rid of compile warning, you can add
 * @SuppressWarnings("deprecation") in front of the deprecated method.
